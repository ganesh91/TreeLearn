# TreeLearn
Tree Based Machine Learning Library for Python developed as a part of Applied Machine Learning.

##Algorithms in the library
1. Decison Trees [Source](https://github.com/ganesh91/TreeLearn/blob/master/mllib/trees/dtree.py)
2. Random Forest [Source](https://github.com/ganesh91/TreeLearn/blob/master/mllib/ensemble/RandomForestClassifier.py)
3. AdaBoost [Source](https://github.com/ganesh91/TreeLearn/blob/master/mllib/ensemble/AdaBoost.py)

##Data Structures
Special Numpy inspired [DataFrame API](https://github.com/ganesh91/TreeLearn/blob/master/mllib/datastructures/DataFrame.py)

The instruction and usage examples are available at [Examples](https://github.com/ganesh91/TreeLearn/tree/master/Examples)

Example benchmarks are done using sample dataset from UCI dataset and can be downloaded at [Decision Trees](https://github.com/ganesh91/TreeLearn/blob/master/Decision_Trees_Documentation_Vs_Weka.pdf) and [Random Forests & AdaBoost](https://github.com/ganesh91/TreeLearn/blob/master/Random_Forest_Ada_Boost_Vs-Weka.pdf).
